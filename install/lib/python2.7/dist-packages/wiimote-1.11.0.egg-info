Description: The wiimote package allows ROS nodes to communicate with a Nintendo Wiimote
            and its related peripherals, including the Nunchuk, Motion Plus, and
            (experimentally) the Classic. The package implements a ROS node that uses
            Bluetooth to communicate with the Wiimote device, obtaining accelerometer
            and gyro data, the state of LEDs, the IR camera, rumble (vibrator),
            buttons, joystick, and battery state. The node additionally enables ROS
            nodes to control the Wiimote's LEDs and vibration for feedback to the human
            Wiimote operator. LEDs and vibration may be switched on and off, or made to
            operate according to a timed pattern.
